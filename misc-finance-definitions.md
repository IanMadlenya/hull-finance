Z-Score = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + 1.0E

In this equation:

A = Working capital/total assets

B = Retained earnings/total assets

C = Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)/total assets

D = Market value of equity/total liabilities

E = Sales/total assets

Typically, a score below 1.8 indicates that a company is likely heading for
or is under the weight of bankruptcy. Conversely, companies that score
above 3 are less likely to experience bankruptcy.
