# Chapter 1

* __Forward contracts__ are one-time, have an exact delivery date,
  and have a delivery price and a price of asset at maturity,
  with the long position favoring increases in price and the short position favoring decreases.

* __Futures contracts__ do not have an exact delivery date, and are instead restricted
  to a whole month. If a commodity is associated with the contract, it can be delivered
  on any day of that month.
