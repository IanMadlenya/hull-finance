# Chapter 1

## Contracts

 * __Forward contracts__ are one-time, have an exact delivery date,
   and have a delivery price and a price of asset at maturity,
   with the long position favoring increases in price and the short position favoring decreases.

 * __Futures contracts__ do not have an exact delivery date, and are instead restricted
   to a whole month. If a commodity is associated with the contract, it can be delivered
   on any day of that month.

## Options

 * Two basic types of options: __call options__ give the holder the right to buy
   the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price; __put options__
   give the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date
   (the expiration date, exercise date, or maturity) for a certain price
   (the exercise or strike price).

 * __American options__ can be exercised on or before the exercise date;
   __European options__ must be exercised exactly on the date.

 * Options _may_ be exercised; contracts _must_ be exercised. Contracts are
   free, option contracts have a price.

 * If `X` is the strike price and `S_T` is the final price of the underlying
   asset, the payoff from a long position in a European call option is
   `max(S_T - X, 0)`. The payoff to the holder of a short position 
   in the European call option is `-max(S_T - X, 0)` or `min(X - S_T, 0)`. 
   The payoff to the holder of a long position in a European put option
   is `max(X - S_T, 0)` and the payoff from a short position in a
   European put option is `-max(X - S_T, 0)` or `min(S_T - X, 0). 

## Other derivative securities

 * An __interest rate cap__ provides protection against the rate of interest
   on a floating-rate loan (i.e., a high-pass filter on interest)

 * You can get very creative with derivative bundling / pricing. For example,
   __ICON__s (index currency option notes) were given out by the Long Term
   Credit Bank of Japan that yielded a bond payout less `max(0, 1000*(169/S - 1))`
   dollars, where `S` is the yen-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Thus, if 
   `S >= 169`, the full bond value is received. If `S <= 169/2 = 84.5`, then
   none of the bond value is received. In essence, this is a combination of
   a high and low-pass filter with respect to some derivative input (in this
   case, an exchange rate).

## Types of traders

 * Traders of derivative securities can be grouped into three classes:
   __hedgers__, __speculators__, and __arbitrageurs__.

 * A __hedger__ is interested in reducing the risk that they already face.
   For example, a company that must pay in a foreign currency can buy
   a long forward contract in that currency to *lock in* the exchange rate.
   The purpose of hedging is to make the outcome more certain. It does not
   necessarily improve the outcome.

   Hedging can be done using, for example, forward contracts and option
   contracts. While option contracts place a cap on the potential cost,
   they can be quite expensive.

 * While hedgers seek to reduce exposure to asset price volatility, 
   speculators take a position in the market. They are either betting 
   on or against the price of an asset in the market.

 * Arbitrageurs take advantage of instantaneous discrepancies in the market.
   For example, if the same stock is traded in New York and in London at
   `$172` and `Â£100`, respectively, but the sterling is trading at `$1.75`,
   then there is an arbitrage opportunity of `(1.75 * 100 - 172) = 3` dollars
   per option. If transaction costs are high (for smaller parties / transactions)
   this may not be worth it, but for large institutions with low transaction
   costs it may. In general, this situation is rare and self-correcting,
   and we assume there are no arbitrage opportunities.
