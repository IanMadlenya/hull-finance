# Chapter 1

 1. A long forward position implies we are not providing the asset, and will buy it at maturity.
    A short forward position implies we are providing the asset and will set it at maturity.

 2. Hedging is attempting to reduce the risk of asset price volatility, e.g., by buying
    an option contract that will be exercised to offset some other loss. Speculating
    is actively betting on changing market conditions by trading derivatives.
    Arbitrage is performing an instantaneous transaction that exploits an inefficiency
    in the market.

 3. A long forward contract must be exercised at maturity, and thus has no cap on loss.
    A long position in a call option does not have to be exercised, and thus only the
    option price is at stake.

 4. (a) He gains (50 - 48.20) * $25,000 = $45k, or (b) loses (51.30 - 50) * $25,000 = $32.5k.

 5. A put option implies you will profit if the stock drops. Thus, you can make up to 
    `(120 - S_3) * 100`, where `S_3` is the stock price after 3 months. You will always
    have to pay the option price, so you are betting on the stock price to fall 
    a little under $120 within 3 months.

 6. You could buy a forward contract at $30, which would collect any gains above $30,
    but also cost any losses. Or, you could buy the 3-month call and make
    on excess of $32.90 in the stock price, with at worst a $2.90 / option liability.

 7. Say a put option costs $1.00 per share with a strike price of $25.00.
    If you buy $5,000 of such options, you have effectively paid 200 shares but
    negated all the risk, since if the stock price drops to zero you can exercise
    your put options.

 8. No, since a stock option may not necessarily be exercised. If it does provide funds,
    they are only available at the option exercise date (assuming it is European; if it
    is American, they may be exercised earlier).

 9. The forward contract can be exercised on its own, or in conjunction with another 
    security. In the latter, it can be used for hedging, e.g., if you take a
    forward contract on an exchange rate while delivering another contract in
    the foreign currency.

 10. If the stock price exceeds ($50.00 + $2.50) = $52.50 at maturity. It will be
     exercised if the stock price exceeds $50.00, since even stock price amounts in
     between can offset some of the loss of the option price (whereas it is worthless
     below $50.00).

 11. If the final stock price is less than ($60.00 - $4.00) = $56.00. It will be
     exercised if stock price is less than $60.00 for similar reasons to #10.

 12. The investor will receive $25.00 - $20.00 - $2.00 = $3.00 per share.

 13. If the price falls below $30.00 - $4.00 = $26.00.

 14. The former, since (assuming the floating rate ever is lower than $10.00)
     it includes scenarios where the average is less than $10.00, whereas
     the latter includes scenarios where the average is exactly $10.00.

 15. Just add the piecewise graphs.

 16. A short forward contract at the current exchange rate, since they will be
     able to sell for exactly that amount in their native currency.

 17. Borrow the full eligible amount and make a (700/500 - 1.10) = 30% profit.

 18. Those from #16 where the US dollar is the foreign currency -- hedgers.

 19. The two strategies yield the same return when `P * 100 = (P - 94 - 4.70) * 2000`,
     so when the price at maturity is $103.895. The option strategy will be
     more profitable beyond that price, so the investor should that strategy
     if they have good reason to expect such a price increase.

 20. There is a short and long position on both options and futures: one party
     will win and the other will lose.

 21. The option can be used to absorb any losses from the forward contract,
     so this portfolio setup is equivalent to a call option with the same 
     strike price and option price as the put option.

 22. For example, if it ranges from $40 to $25, that is a $40
     put option with a $25 put option. It can be constructed to be zero value
     if the difference between the two option strike prices
     is the sum of their option price.

 23. ?

 24. The company will make `S_sep - S_july`, where `S_T` is the stock
     price at month T.

 25. (a) An arbitrage opportunity of $0.0029, and (b) $0.0010 per option.

 26. Ignoring the option price, this is just the simple statement that the
     two piece-wise graphs make a line equivalent to the return on contract
     volatility. You make money when it goes up and lose money if it goes down.

# Chapter 2

 1. Open interest indicates the total number of contracts outstanding (i.e.,
    the total number of long, or equivalently short, positions). The trading volume
    is the total number of trades executed that day. If it far exceeds open interest,
    this indicates a large amount of day trading.

 2. A commission broker executes trades on behalf of clients, whereas a local
    executes trades on their own behalf.
 
 3. We need to solve for `5000 * x = 1000`, so a drop of over `$0.20` per
    ounce would lead to a margin call.

 4. The company's total profit is 1000 * (70.50 - 68.30) = $2,200,
    realized at the end of March 2010. If it is a hedger, then the
    full profit is taxed in 2010. Otherwise, 1000 * (70.50 - 69.10) = 
    $1,400 is taxed in 2010 and 1000 * (69.10 - 68.30) = $800 is taxed
    in 2009.

 5. It means to sell at $2 or less as soon as the market price reaches $2.
    It might be used if the investor wishes to close out a position if
    unfavorable price movements take place. It limits the loss that
    can be incurred.

    A limit order to sell means to sell at $2 or more as soon as the
    market price reaches $2. It is used if the investor wishes to wait
    and sell exactly at (or better) than this price. It might never be reached.

 6. The clearninghouse marging account, unlike the broker margin account, 
    does not need to post margin calls. Instead, it balances the accounts between
    short and long positions to equal exactly the initial margin at end of day.

 7. ?

 8. *The party with a short position in a futures contract sometimes has options
    as to the precise asset that will be delivered, where delivery will take place,
    when delivery will take place, and so on. Do these options increase or
    decrease the futures price? Explain your reasoning.*

    The grade of the asset may influence price. For example, #1 and #3 yellow corn
    increase and decrease the price of corn by 1.50 cents per bushel, respectively,
    when substituted for #2 yellow corn.

    Delivery usually has to take place within several days of the intent to deliver
    call. It must occur at pre-established facilities, or may sometimes be 
    delivered elsewhere at a slight premium according to the distance from the
    origination of the asset.

 9. *What are the most important aspects of the design of a new futures contract?*
 
    The grade of the asset, the delivery options, etc.

 10. *Explain how margins protect investors against the possibility of default.*
 
    If a trading client defaults, the broker can draw funds from the other margin
    accounts to substitute the default.

 11. *A trader buys two July futures contracts on orange juice. Each contract is
    for delivery of 15,000 pounds. The current futures price is 160 cents per pound,
    the initial margin is $6,000 per contract, and the maintenance margin is
    $4,500 per contract. What price change would lead to a margin call? Under what
    circumstances could $2,000 be withdrawn from the margin account?* 

    A margin call results from a decrease of $1,500 / 15,000 = $0.10 = 10 cents per pound.
    Conversely, a price rise by $2,000 / 15,000 = $0.13 = 13 cents per pound (assuming
    the margin account was at the initial margin) would allow for a $2,000 withdrawal.

 12. *Show that, if the futures prices of a commodity is greater than the spot price 
    during the delivery period, then there is an arbitrary opportunity. Does an
    arbitrage opportunity exist if the futures price is less than the spot price?
    Explain your answer.*

    Yes to both cases. In the former, a company could buy the asset and sell shortly
    at the futures price by shorting a contract and making delivery. In the latter,
    a company interested in acquiring the asset could enter into a long futures contract
    and wait for delivery to be made.

 13. *Explain the difference between a market-if-touched order and a stop order.*
   
    A market-if-touched order says to sell at best available market price if a
    certain market price is reached. A stop order says to sell at a given price
    or worse than a given price as soon as the market price reaches the given price.

 14. *Explain what a stop-limit order to sell at 20.30 with a limit of 20.10 means*

    As soon as the market price hits 20.30, sell for less than 20.30 but more than 20.10.

 15. *At the end of one day a clearinghouse member is long 100 contracts, and the settlement
    price is $50,000 per contract. The original margin is $2,000 per contract.
    On the following day the member becomes responsible for clearing an additional 20
    long contracts, entered into at a price of $51,000 per contract. The settlement
    price at the end of this day is $50,200. How much does the member have to add to
    its margin account with the exchange clearinghouse?*

    The price drop equates to a 20 * (51,000 - 50,200) = $16,000 margin call.

 16. *On July 1, 2009, a Japanese company enters into a forward contract to buy $1 million
    on January 1, 2010. On September 1, 2009, it enters into a forward contract to sell
    $1 million on January 1, 2010. Describe the profit or loss the company will make in
    yen as a function of the forward exchange rates on July 1, 2009, and September 1,
    2009.*

    The profit is given by (Y_1 - Y_2) * $1million, where Y_2 and Y_1 are the number of
    yen equivalent to $1US in September and July, respectively. For example,
    if $1US = 4Y in July and 5Y in September, then 1Y = $0.25 and $0.20 in those months,
    respectively, and thus the company made a net loss.

 17. *The forward price of the Swiss franc for delivery in 45 days is quoted as 1.25000.
    The futures price for a contract that will be delivered in 45 days is 0.7980.
    Explain these two quotes. Which one is more favorable for an investor
    wanting to sell Swiss francs?*

    The forward price is more favorable, since Swiss francs will be worth more.
    The futures price will settle daily and so may require margins. It is also
    not guaranteed to be identical to the eventual spot price.

 18. *Suppose you call your broker and issue instructions to sell one July hogs contract.
    Describe what happens.*

    The broker marks your short position for one July hogs contract and requires an
    initial margin.

 19. *"Speculation in futures markets is pure gambling. It is not in the public interest to
    allow speculators to trade on a futures exchange.*" Without speculators, the market
    would have little liquidity and there would be no room for hedging either.

 20. *Identify the commodities whose futures contracts have the highest open
    interest in Table 2.2*

    Crude oil, gold, corn, wheat, and sugar.

 21. *What do you think would happen if an exchange started trading a contract in which
    the quality of the underlying asset was incompletely specified?*

    Only the worst (and hence cheapest) quality would be delivered, or at least the
    components that were not specified would be done so.

 22. *"When a futures contract is traded on the floor of the exchange, it may be the
    case that the open interest increases by one, stays the same, or decreases by one."
    Explain this statement. *

    Not sure, but I believe it may go on the market, off the market (i.e., intent
    to deliver), or pass from a short to long or vice versa.

 23. *Suppose that, on October 24, 2009, a company sells one April 2010 live
    cattle futures contract. It closes out its position on January 21, 2010.
    The futures price (per pound) is 91.20 cents when it enters into the
    contract, 88.30 cents when it closes out its position, and 88.80 cents
    at the end of December 2009. One contract is for the delivery of 40,000 
    pounds of cattle. What is the total profit? How is it taxed if the company is
    (a) a hedger, and (b) a speculator? Assume that the company has a December 31
    year-end.*

    The total profit is 40,000 * (91.20 - 88.30) = $116,000. In the first case,
    it is taxed at that amount in 2010. In the latter, it is taxed 40,000 * (91.20 - 88.80) =
    $96,000 in 2009 and 40,000 * (88.80 - 88.30) = $20,000 in 2010.

 24. *A cattle farmer expects to have 120,000 pounds of live cattle to sell in
    3 months. The live cattle futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
    is for the delivery of 40,000 pounds of cattle. How can the farmer use the contract
    for hedging? From the farmer's viewpoint, what are the pros and cons of hedging?*

    The farmer can buy three contracts and be guaranteed to sell at a given price.
    On the one hand, the price of cattle may go up and he may miss out on a profit.
    On the other hand, he will be much more certain of his profit and will avoid risk,
    making it easier to make long-term financial decisions.

  25. *It is July 2008. A mining company has just discovered a small deposit of gold.
    It will take 6 months to construct the mine. The gold will then be extracted on
    a more or less continuous basis for 1 year. Futures contracts on gold are 
    available on the New York Commodity Exchange. There are delivery months every
    2 months from August 2008 to December 2009. Each contract is for the delivery
    of 100 ounces. Discoss how the mining company might use futures markets for
    hedging.*

    The company should forecast how much gold they expect to mine every two months,
    and sell the equivalent contracts to lock in the eventual spot price.

  26. *A company enters into a short futures contract to sell 5,000 bushels of wheat
    for 450 cents per bushel. The initial margin is $3,000 and the maintenance
    margin is $2,000. What price change would lead to a margin call?
    Under what circumstances could $1,500 be withdrawn from the margin account?*

    A margin call would trigger on a price drop of $1,000 / 5,000 = $0.20 = 20 cents
    per bushel. One could withdraw $1,500 from the margin account if the price
    rose $1,500 / 5000 = $0.30 = 30 cents.

  27. *Suppose that there are no storage costs for crude oil and the interest
    rate for borrowing or lending is 5% per annum. How could you make money on
    Janaury 8, 2007, by trading June 2007 and December 2007 contracts? Use
    Table 2.2.*

    On Jan 9, the June contract was 60.01 with a change of 0.10, so it
    was 59.91 the day before. The December contract was 62.94 with a change
    of 0.28, so it was 62.66 the day before. We could go long on the June
    contract by borrowing, receive the oil, and short the December contract 
    and return the borrowed funds, which cost 59.91 * e^(0.05 / 2) = 61.43.
