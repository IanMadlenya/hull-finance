# Chapter 1

 1. A long forward position implies we are not providing the asset, and will buy it at maturity.
    A short forward position implies we are providing the asset and will set it at maturity.

 2. Hedging is attempting to reduce the risk of asset price volatility, e.g., by buying
    an option contract that will be exercised to offset some other loss. Speculating
    is actively betting on changing market conditions by trading derivatives.
    Arbitrage is performing an instantaneous transaction that exploits an inefficiency
    in the market.

 3. A long forward contract must be exercised at maturity, and thus has no cap on loss.
    A long position in a call option does not have to be exercised, and thus only the
    option price is at stake.

 4. (a) He gains (50 - 48.20) * $25,000 = $45k, or (b) loses (51.30 - 50) * $25,000 = $32.5k.

 5. A put option implies you will profit if the stock drops. Thus, you can make up to 
    `(120 - S_3) * 100`, where `S_3` is the stock price after 3 months. You will always
    have to pay the option price, so you are betting on the stock price to fall 
    a little under $120 within 3 months.
