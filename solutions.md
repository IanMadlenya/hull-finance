# Chapter 1

 1. A long forward position implies we are not providing the asset, and will buy it at maturity.
    A short forward position implies we are providing the asset and will set it at maturity.

 2. Hedging is attempting to reduce the risk of asset price volatility, e.g., by buying
    an option contract that will be exercised to offset some other loss. Speculating
    is actively betting on changing market conditions by trading derivatives.
    Arbitrage is performing an instantaneous transaction that exploits an inefficiency
    in the market.

 3. A long forward contract must be exercised at maturity, and thus has no cap on loss.
    A long position in a call option does not have to be exercised, and thus only the
    option price is at stake.

 4. (a) He gains (50 - 48.20) * $25,000 = $45k, or (b) loses (51.30 - 50) * $25,000 = $32.5k.

 5. A put option implies you will profit if the stock drops. Thus, you can make up to 
    `(120 - S_3) * 100`, where `S_3` is the stock price after 3 months. You will always
    have to pay the option price, so you are betting on the stock price to fall 
    a little under $120 within 3 months.

 6. You could buy a forward contract at $30, which would collect any gains above $30,
    but also cost any losses. Or, you could buy the 3-month call and make
    on excess of $32.90 in the stock price, with at worst a $2.90 / option liability.

 7. Say a put option costs $1.00 per share with a strike price of $25.00.
    If you buy $5,000 of such options, you have effectively paid 200 shares but
    negated all the risk, since if the stock price drops to zero you can exercise
    your put options.

 8. No, since a stock option may not necessarily be exercised. If it does provide funds,
    they are only available at the option exercise date (assuming it is European; if it
    is American, they may be exercised earlier).

 9. The forward contract can be exercised on its own, or in conjunction with another 
    security. In the latter, it can be used for hedging, e.g., if you take a
    forward contract on an exchange rate while delivering another contract in
    the foreign currency.

 10. If the stock price exceeds ($50.00 + $2.50) = $52.50 at maturity. It will be
     exercised if the stock price exceeds $50.00, since even stock price amounts in
     between can offset some of the loss of the option price (whereas it is worthless
     below $50.00).

 11. If the final stock price is less than ($60.00 - $4.00) = $56.00. It will be
     exercised if stock price is less than $60.00 for similar reasons to #10.

 12. The investor will receive $25.00 - $20.00 - $2.00 = $3.00 per share.

 13. If the price falls below $30.00 - $4.00 = $26.00.

 14. The former, since (assuming the floating rate ever is lower than $10.00)
     it includes scenarios where the average is less than $10.00, whereas
     the latter includes scenarios where the average is exactly $10.00.

 15. Just add the piecewise graphs.

 16. A short forward contract at the current exchange rate, since they will be
     able to sell for exactly that amount in their native currency.

 17. Borrow the full eligible amount and make a (700/500 - 1.10) = 30% profit.

 18. Those from #16 where the US dollar is the foreign currency -- hedgers.

 19. The two strategies yield the same return when `P * 100 = (P - 94 - 4.70) * 2000`,
     so when the price at maturity is $103.895. The option strategy will be
     more profitable beyond that price, so the investor should that strategy
     if they have good reason to expect such a price increase.

 20. There is a short and long position on both options and futures: one party
     will win and the other will lose.

 21. The option can be used to absorb any losses from the forward contract,
     so this portfolio setup is equivalent to a call option with the same 
     strike price and option price as the put option.

 22. For example, if it ranges from $40 to $25, that is a $40
     put option with a $25 put option. It can be constructed to be zero value
     if the difference between the two option strike prices
     is the sum of their option price.

 23. ?

 24. The company will make `S_sep - S_july`, where `S_T` is the stock
     price at month T.

 25. (a) An arbitrage opportunity of $0.0029, and (b) $0.0010 per option.

 26. Ignoring the option price, this is just the simple statement that the
     two piece-wise graphs make a line equivalent to the return on contract
     volatility. You make money when it goes up and lose money if it goes down.
